This repository open-sources the training code of InternVL3.5 during the online RL stage, which is built upon the [PR](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/pull/2327) in [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl). Compared to the original PR, we have corrected the dialogue template for InternVL and updated a monkey patch for InternVL to enable sequence-parallel. For training details, please refer to the provided [scripts](shell).

We use [MMPR-Tiny](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenGVLab/MMPR-Tiny) as the training dataset and initialize the model with InternVL3.5 trained after MPO. We also provide a [packaged conda environment](https://huggingface.co/Weiyun1025/InternVL3_5-RL-conda-env/blob/main/verl-internvl.tar.gz) for easy reproduction.

For the original README of verl, please refer to [this file](README_verl.md).

## Experimental Results

Based on this codebase, the InternVL3.5 series across all model scales achieve a significant improvement in reasoning performance.

## Quick Start

### Training

We open-source our training data (i.e., [MMPR-Tiny](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenGVLab/MMPR-Tiny)) on HuggingFace. To reproduce our training results, you need to download this dataset and move it into this folder.
Additionally, considering that verl requires a validation dataset to be loaded, please prepare this data using this [script](examples/data_preprocess/geo3k.py).

```
├── MMPR-Tiny
│   ├── images
│   └── mmpr_tiny.parquet
├── verl_data
│   └── geo3k
│       └── test.parquet
├── verl
└── README.md
```

We also provide a [packaged conda environment](https://huggingface.co/Weiyun1025/InternVL3_5-RL-conda-env/blob/main/verl-internvl.tar.gz) for easy reproduction. After preparing the dataset and conda environment, you can launch the training using the commond as follows:

```shell
sh shell/internvl3_5_8b.sh
```



### Evaluation

We mainly use [VLMEvalkit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit) to evaluate our models. Please refer to their documentation and our model configs for more details. As an example, you can set the config as follows:

```python
"InternVL3_5-8B-Thinking": partial(
    InternVLChat,
    model_path="/path/to/your/moel",
    version="V2.0",
    cot_prompt_version="r1",
    max_new_tokens=32768,
    do_sample=True,
    use_lmdeploy=True,
),
```
